* [Kubernetes LEMP Stack](https://github.com/chepurko/k8s-lemp) - Kubernetes LEMP Stack is a distributed LEMP stack built on top of a Kubernetes cluster. It enables anyone to deploy multiple CMSs (currently WordPress) for any number of websites. We built it to be secure and very fast by default.
* [NGNIX WordPress Docker](https://github.com/raulr/nginx-wordpress-docker) - The official WordPress image has a PHP-FPM variant, but it still needs a web server to handle HTTP requests. This image provides an Nginx server ready to use as a wordpress:fpm front-end.
