## Tools
* [Kubernetes Auto-Ingress](https://github.com/hxquangnhat/kubernetes-auto-ingress) - Dynamically create an ingress for an associated service for Kubernetes, works with NGNIX ingress controller.
* [Kubernetes LEMP Stack](https://github.com/chepurko/k8s-lemp) - Kubernetes LEMP Stack is a distributed LEMP stack built on top of a Kubernetes cluster. It enables anyone to deploy multiple CMSs (currently WordPress) for any number of websites. We built it to be secure and very fast by default.
* [NGNIX WordPress Docker](https://github.com/raulr/nginx-wordpress-docker) - The official WordPress image has a PHP-FPM variant, but it still needs a web server to handle HTTP requests. This image provides an Nginx server ready to use as a wordpress:fpm front-end.
* [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) - Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.
* [Kube Lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego) - Kube Lego automatically requests certificates for Kubernetes Ingress resources from Let's Encrypt.
* [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns) - ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.
* [Kubespray Wrapper](https://github.com/kubespray/kubespray-cli) - Easy to use command line tool for kubernetes deployment with kubespray.
* [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray) - Setup a kubernetes cluster.
* [Cluster capacity analysis framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cluster-capacity) - Cluster capacity analysis.
* [Kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm) - Kubernetes installation with kubeadm really simplifies deployment procedure and it is easy to use.
* [Kubernetes Elasticsearch Cluster](https://github.com/pires/kubernetes-elasticsearch-cluster) - Elasticsearch cluster on top of Kubernetes made easy.

## Tutorials
* [Kubernetes Nginx Ingress controller](https://crondev.com/kubernetes-nginx-ingress-controller/) - Ingress is the built‑in Kubernetes load‑balancing framework for HTTP traffic. With Ingress, you control the routing of external traffic.
* [Kubernetes installation with kubeadm](https://crondev.com/kubernetes-installation-kubeadm/) - Please note that kubeadm is still in Alpha and not ready for production use, but it is good enough to play with on development environments.
* [Kubernetes upgrade – kubeadm](https://crondev.com/kubernetes-upgrade-kubeadm/) - Kubeadm is still in beta, but if you already deployed a Kubernetes cluster on some environment using it and now want to upgrade, you can do that manually.
