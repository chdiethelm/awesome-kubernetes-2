## Tools
* [Kubernetes Auto-Ingress](https://github.com/hxquangnhat/kubernetes-auto-ingress) - Dynamically create an ingress for an associated service for Kubernetes, works with NGNIX ingress controller.
* [Kubernetes LEMP Stack](https://github.com/chepurko/k8s-lemp) - Kubernetes LEMP Stack is a distributed LEMP stack built on top of a Kubernetes cluster. It enables anyone to deploy multiple CMSs (currently WordPress) for any number of websites. We built it to be secure and very fast by default.
* [NGNIX WordPress Docker](https://github.com/raulr/nginx-wordpress-docker) - The official WordPress image has a PHP-FPM variant, but it still needs a web server to handle HTTP requests. This image provides an Nginx server ready to use as a wordpress:fpm front-end.
* [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) - Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.
* [Kube Lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego) - Kube Lego automatically requests certificates for Kubernetes Ingress resources from Let's Encrypt.
* [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-dns) - ExternalDNS synchronizes exposed Kubernetes Services and Ingresses with DNS providers.
* [Kubespray Wrapper](https://github.com/kubespray/kubespray-cli) - Easy to use command line tool for kubernetes deployment with kubespray.
* [Kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray) - Setup a kubernetes cluster.
* [Cluster capacity analysis framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cluster-capacity) - Cluster capacity analysis.
* [Kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm) - Kubernetes installation with kubeadm really simplifies deployment procedure and it is easy to use.
* [Kubernetes Elasticsearch Cluster](https://github.com/pires/kubernetes-elasticsearch-cluster) - Elasticsearch cluster on top of Kubernetes made easy.
* [Spread](https://github.com/redspread/spread) - Spread is a command line tool that makes it easy to version Kubernetes clusters, deploy to Kubernetes clusters in one command, and set up a local Kubernetes cluster.
* [Teresa](https://github.com/luizalabs/teresa-api) - Teresa is an extremely simple platform as a service that runs on top of Kubernetes.The API needs a database backend and access to Amazon S3 for storage.
* [Kube Latency](https://github.com/simonswine/kube-latency) - This is a simple little tool, that helps to measure bandwidth and latency in a kubernetes Pod Network.
* [Kubernetes Vault Integration](https://github.com/Boostport/kubernetes-vault) - The Kubernetes-Vault project allows pods to automatically receive a Vault token using Vault's AppRole auth backend.
* [K8sec](https://github.com/dtan4/k8sec) - CLI tool to manage Kubernetes Secrets easily.
* [Redis Cluster on Kubernetes](https://github.com/sobotklp/kubernetes-redis-cluster) - This k8s module is intended to simplify the creation and operation of a Redis Cluster deployment in Kubernetes.
* [KubeNow](https://github.com/kubenow/KubeNow) - KubeNow is a cloud agnostic platform for microservices, based on Docker and Kubernetes. Other than lighting-fast Kubernetes operations, KubeNow helps you in lifting your final application configuring DNS records and distributed storage.
* [NGINX for Kubernetes Reloaded](https://github.com/rosskukulinski/nginx-kubernetes-reload) - Containerized NGINX that watches for configuration file changes from Kubernetes Secrets or ConfigMaps.

## Tutorials
* [Kubernetes Nginx Ingress controller](https://crondev.com/kubernetes-nginx-ingress-controller/) - Ingress is the built‑in Kubernetes load‑balancing framework for HTTP traffic. With Ingress, you control the routing of external traffic.
* [Kubernetes installation with kubeadm](https://crondev.com/kubernetes-installation-kubeadm/) - Please note that kubeadm is still in Alpha and not ready for production use, but it is good enough to play with on development environments.
* [Kubernetes upgrade – kubeadm](https://crondev.com/kubernetes-upgrade-kubeadm/) - Kubeadm is still in beta, but if you already deployed a Kubernetes cluster on some environment using it and now want to upgrade, you can do that manually.
* [Distributed Load Testing Using Kubernetes](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/distributed-load-testing-using-kubernetes) - Load testing is key to the development of any backend infrastructure because load tests demonstrate how well the system functions when faced with real-world demands.
* [Monitoring Your Kubernetes Infrastructure With Prometheus](https://www.weave.works/blog/monitoring-kubernetes-infrastructure/) - Monitoring Your Kubernetes Infrastructure With Prometheus.
* [Code Cooking: Kubernetes](https://medium.com/google-cloud/code-cooking-kubernetes-e715728a578c) - Using Google CDN with Kubernetes.
